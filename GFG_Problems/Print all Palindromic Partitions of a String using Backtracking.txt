Print all Palindromic Partitions of a String using Backtracking
Given a string, find all possible palindromic partitions of given string.

Note that this problem is different from Palindrome Partitioning Problem, there the task was to find the partitioning with minimum cuts in input string. Here we need to print all possible partitions.

Example: 

Input:  nitin
Output: n i t i n
        n iti n
        nitin



Input:  geeks
Output: g e e k s
        g ee k s
